you know put the customer at ease and describe a little bit about how the interview will work this is how Michael does it thanks so much for coming and helping me with this I definitely appreciate it if you've done something like this before I haven't okay maybe I'll explain a little bit I know what I'm up to I'm so when we're developing new designs and new ideas and things like that we get to a point where it's really valuable to get some fresh eyes and some fresh perspective on it and so that's how I need your help what I'd love to do is just spend some time chatting with you about some stuff just it's pretty casual and then I'll show you some different designs and some ideas I'll ask you a lot of questions but I don't want it to feel like I'm testing you I'm trying to figure out if these designs work if they make sense and so I'm testing the designs and the way I'll do that as I'll show it to you and ask you to think aloud as you're looking at these so I'm trying to see it through fresh eyes see it through your eyes after the introduction you'll probably be itching to bring out the prototype and see how your customer reacts but not so fast first you want to learn a little bit about the customer you're gonna have a natural conversation in act 2 but you're going to be asking some specific questions to learn some background info so in this example Michael wants to find out about the customers exercise and fitness habits so maybe just for starters can tell me a little bit about the kind of work you do so I'm an executive assistant and I've been doing that for about 8 or 9 years and so what does that involve scheduling meetings doing expenses booking travel and basically just making sure that the lives of my executives run smoothly it sounds like a busy day it's always a busy day and what kinds of things do you do when you're not working you have certain kinds of hobbies or things that you like to do so yeah I like to go shopping I like to hang out outside with my daughter go to the playground with her or go on a walk hiking things like that um movies hang out with friends things like that and things like the hiking and the walking are there other things like that that you do to take care of yourself to keep in shape yeah I mean I used to be a member of a gym but I'm not now and I but I do like to stay active so I like playing tennis and that's basically the only sport that I play but I do like to like I said go on walks or go forever or things like that so after about ten minutes of conversation you'll be ready to bring out the prototype in act 3 you introduce the prototype and you want to do it in such a way that the customer feels comfortable giving you frank and candid feedback about it you want to make sure that they don't feel like they're being tested in any way what I want to show you this is a prototype of another and so what that means is that some things work and some things might not work but we'll just kind of try it and there's no way to break it or anything so we'll just kind of try it and again like I mentioned before what I'm doing is I'm testing the prototype and these designs I'm not testing you I'm gonna be asking you all the questions right but there's not a right or wrong answer we're just gonna try to you know try it out and see how it goes can you think of it sure um and again as we do that if you think aloud it really helps me kind of see it through your eyes let's try this out in the real world your product will live on its own you won't be there to guide customers along and tell them exactly what to do and how to use it so in your interview to get the most realistic results possible in act 4 you're just gonna give the customer some tasks and you're gonna mostly watch what they do occasionally asking questions just to encourage them to think aloud what would you do if you're looking for a new fitness app like we were doing before just search a star okay so you see this featured app yeah so maybe let's take a look at this one okay so what's going on here asking when you like to work out so days of the week so for you what would you choose I would choose probably Tuesday Thursday and Saturday and then asks for the time of day probably have to do in the evening it's asking to send notifications okay fits our profile name height weight age and fitness goals what's this for let's see weight loss muscle gains strength or overall so for you what would you put in all the stuff if anything for the fitness goals for any of it I going to do with the screen so I would enter my height I'm guessing feet and inches my weight which maybe I would lie a little bit my age I guess you shouldn't lie about your weight on a fitness app but and then I'd probably select weight loss maybe overalls I don't really know what overall means like if it means toning or stretching and things like that and what do you think each of these would mean so weight loss you'll lose weight muscle gain I figure you're gonna get bigger muscles and I don't really want strength I kind of think is the same as muscle gain at least I feel like the results would be the same and overall like I said I don't really know what overall means at the end of the interview you're gonna ask the customer some debrief questions so through the course of the first four acts you'll have heard a lot seen a lot of reactions it can sometimes be hard to make sense of what's most important in act 5 when you ask these debrief questions the customer will actually help you sift through everything you've heard so so far as we've gone through this mr. kind curious what you what you think of this I think it's interesting I think it looks pretty cool it's always nice to have someone or something telling you what to do in order to get the results that you want so it's helpful to have it outlined like this and they say ok do this many jumping jacks and then do this many push-up so kind of lays it out pretty easily I think and what do you think of the parts that you don't like as much I don't think it's a big deal but I just think that there's maybe a few tweaks like I haven't seen a woman since the very first video so that's kind of a market that I think they're losing out on there unless this is going to be just tailored for men but other than that I think it's just kind of small tweaks
